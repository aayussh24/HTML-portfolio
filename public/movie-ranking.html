<h1>The Best Movies According to Aayush </h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>

<p>Deep dives into the life of the man who made maybe one of the most horrific man-made things. </p>

<h3>Rocky Series </h3>

<p>Can't decide on one movie from the series. I love them all. They inspired me to try boxing. </p>

<h3>Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift </h3>

<p>I really like JDM cars and this movie has a really beautifull representation of the racing scene in Japan. </p>
